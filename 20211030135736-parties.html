<p>
I used to not really understand the appeal of parties.
</p>

<p>
What is the fun of going and superficially talking to a bunch of people that you don't really know and flapping around on the dance floor?
</p>

<p>
I was confused by this, and so was <a href="20211030150001-jerry_ye.html#ID-98320da3-c5a6-412b-ba87-ed8cdb1807e2">Jerry Ye</a>. Why do people spend so much time partying.
</p>

<p>
Over the past few days I've developed a much better understanding for it.
</p>

<p>
The main idea is that before I was trying to analyze the events involved in the party without considering the alcohol. By breaking parties down into its events, it doesn't seem very fun at all. Off the top of my head the main events are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>superficial conversation with people you are never going to see again / have nothing interesting to talk about with</li>
<li>dancing</li>
<li>talk to girls</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are exceptions to the above of course, most notable of which is the occasional interesting conversation. If you are trying to optimize for interesting conversation though, I don't think a party with lots of people and loud music is the place to do it.
</p>

<p>
The main "practical" event seems to be talking to girls.
</p>

<p>
Now i've realized that the fun of parties comes from the alcohol. The above events aren't fun normally, but after you've had enough to drink they become very fun. Once you've had a lot to drink pretty much everything becomes fun especially when you are with other drunk people.
</p>

<p>
I just went to a halloween party last night and I tried to describe the fun events to <a href="20211030155110-simon_berens.html#ID-e60055bb-0e20-4dd7-99fd-ce9bebb394de">Simon Berens</a>. The next day it was hard to describe why it was fun because I wasn't drunk anymore and the only reason they were fun is because I was drunk.
</p>

<p>
So now I have a revised position on parties. They are fun, you just need to drink. They are typically not productive though, but that's okay. The goal is not for them to be productive, the goal is for them to be fun.

<h2 id="orgfe2ad38"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Why Go To A Party When You Have A Girlfriend</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
With my previous impression that parties are not fun and that the main practical reason to go to one is to talk to girls, I was confused why people would go to parties if they had a girlfriend. Why not just go hang out with your girlfriend instead?
</p>

<p>
The answer is alcohol. Sure hanging out with your girlfriend is fun, but it's a different type of fun to get wasted with a lot of other wasted people in a high energy environment.
</p>

<p>
Basically I just didn't see parties as fun before; of course given that parties are not fun people would rather hang out with their girlfriend than do something that isn't fun. Previously I had misjudged how fun parties were.

<h2 id="org093ee25"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Why Do People Spend So Much Time Partying</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There was another question I had: Why do people spend so much time partying? Why don't they have other stuff to do? The answer I discovered is that oftentimes people have nothing else to do.
</p>

<p>
I've been feeling this a bit more now that I have a job that I really like.
</p>

<p>
When interning at Cisco the job wasn't really fulfilling, so I would continue to work on my own more fulfilling projects at the end of the day after I was finished with my job for the day.
</p>

<p>
Now my main job is fulfilling, so after work it's like what do I do? My options are to continue working or to do other productive activities like blog / read.
</p>

<p>
That's all good and fine, but this applies even more so on the weekends. Previously I would just work on side projects all weekends. Now if I want to do that it means working on my job. That's all good and fine, but without short deadlines I don't need to spend as much time coding. This means I have more time to relax. Basically, parties become much more appealing when you don't have side projects and have free time. Parties are one of the more fun things you can do (alcohol remember).
</p>

<p>
Really the question is: why do people spend so much time having fun. And the answer is that if you have free time it makes sense to spend it having fun if you aren't working on side projects. But so how do people decide whether or not to work on side projects? I haven't figured this out.

<h2 id="orgdf82ca5"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> What is the optimal amount of time to spend on parties?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The point of parties is to have fun, so this is kind of like asking what is the optimal amount of time to spend having fun. What is the optimal amount of time to spend having fun and how does it very across people? I'm not sure yet.
